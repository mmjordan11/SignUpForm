# SignUpForm
Sign-up Form project from The Odin Project to practice building a web form with
HTML and CSS from scratch.

**Live Preview** [https://mmjordan11.github.io/signUpForm/](https://mmjordan11.github.io/signUpForm/)

## Skills Practiced
- Using semantic HTML to create a form.
- Using CSS to reset form element default formats and replace with custom
styling.
- Using advanced CSS selectors and pseudo-elements.
- More work with Flexbox.

## Reflection
1. This project was completed mostly as a review of HTML & CSS after taking
approximately 9 months off from coding.
2. I learned a lot more about:
    - Styling form elements.
    - The existence of more form element attributes (ie: pattern)
    - Using ::before, ::after, :valid, & :invalid.
3. I forgot to commit major changes... Committed entire initial project on
first commit. Make sure to commit more often with any future updates.
4. I really like the mobile-first styling approach. I think it makes a lot of
sense in today's mobile heavy usage. It is easier than I thought to style for
different device sizes using @media queries.
4. I feel confident that given a page design, I can recreate it with HTML & CSS.
